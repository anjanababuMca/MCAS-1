<h1>Tree Data Structure</h1>
<p>Root: The root node is the topmost node in the tree hierarchy. In other words, the root node is the one that doesn't have any parent. In the above structure, node numbered 1 is the root node of the tree. If a node is directly linked to some other node, it would be called a parent-child relationship.
Child node: If the node is a descendant of any code, then the node is known as a child node. Parent: If the node contains any sub-node, then node is said to be the parent of that sub-node. Sibling: The nodea that have the same parent are known as siblings.</p>
